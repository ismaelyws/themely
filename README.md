# Themely cPanel Plugin
---

### WordPress Auto-Installer & Theme Directory

#### Themely cPanel plugin is an easy-to-use, one-click WordPress auto-installer combined with a directory of free WordPress themes from talented developers around the world. Not only is it free, it pays you each month!

#### My Mission is to help web hosting companies & WordPress theme developers make more money.


## For Web Hosting Companies
---

- Earn monthly recurring revenue from the listing and sales of WordPress themes.
- Offset your cPanel license fee increases (due to recent price changes).
- Beginner friendly, simple & fast WordPress auto-installer.
- Reduce WordPress related support tickets (we provide links to documentation & tutorials for WordPress).
- Security minded - we set secure default usernames, passwords and database table prefixes.
- Clear & intuitive cPanel icon & title (so users don't have to search or ask support techs where to install WordPress).
- We only approve themes to our directory that meet our strict quality & security standards.
- Only the latest, stable version of WordPress installed (the plugin downloads the latest version directly from the WordPress.org repository and doesn't modify any of the core files).


## For WordPress Theme Developers
---

- Market your free or freemium* themes directly to your target audience (bypass Google, WordPress.org, ThemeForest & Mojo Marketplace).
- Guaranteed minimum number of daily downloads (avoid over-saturated & hyper-competitive marketplaces & directories).
- Proportional listing fees, billed monthly (based on a multiple of the amount you sell your theme upgrade).
- Cancel anytime, no contract, no cancellation fees (listing fees will be prorated by day, for example, if listing fees costs $200 a month but you cancel half way trough, we'll only charge you $100).
- Short review process (7-10 days compared to 3-5 months with WordPress.org)

*freemium = free with option to upgrade*
