# Themely cPanel Plugin

### WordPress Auto-Installer & Theme Directory

#### Themely cPanel plugin is an easy-to-use, one-click WordPress auto-installer combined with a directory of free WordPress themes from talented developers around the world. Not only is it free, it pays you each month!

#### My mission is to help web hosting companies & WordPress theme developers make more money.


## For Web Hosting Companies

- Earn monthly recurring revenue* from the listing and sales of WordPress themes.
- Beginner friendly, simple & fast WordPress auto-installer.
- Reduce WordPress related support tickets (we provide links to documentation & tutorials for WordPress).
- Security minded - we set secure default usernames, passwords and database table prefixes.
- Clear & intuitive cPanel icon & title (so users don't have to search or ask support techs where to install WordPress).
- Offer your clients hundreds of free, beautiful & secure WordPress themes from talented developers around the world.
- We only approve themes to our directory that successfully pass our manual quality & security review process (we adhere to the official WordPress.org theme security guidelines).
- Only the latest, stable version of WordPress installed (the plugin downloads the latest version directly from the WordPress.org repository and doesn't modify any of the core files).
- WP admin single sign-on - after installation users can automatically sign into their Admin Dashboard.
- Integrated with WHMCS (automatically installs WordPress after cPanel account creation) - Download hook function file 

***Revenue**: A fixed amount (TBD) per active cPanel account.*


## For WordPress Theme Developers

- Market your freemium* themes directly to your target audience (bypass Google, WordPress.org, ThemeForest & Mojo Marketplace).
- Guaranteed minimum number of daily downloads (avoid over-saturated & hyper-competitive marketplaces & directories).
- Proportional listing fees, billed monthly (based on a multiple of the amount you sell a theme upgrade).
- Cancel anytime, no contract, no cancellation fees (listing fees will be prorated by day, for example, if listing fees costs $200 a month but you cancel half way trough, we'll only charge you $100).
- Short review process (less than 7 days compared to 10-14 days with ThemeForest.net & 3-5 months with WordPress.org)

*freemium = free with option to upgrade*

## Live Demo

I've set up a tiny cloud server with a cPanel license for you to try and test the plugin.

URL: https://li2000-228.members.linode.com/cpanel

Username: `wpthemespot`

Password: `Y3nRKLutOIyqXxohx9`

Once logged in, scroll down to the **Software section** and click **Install WordPress**.

**Important Notice**: The Themely cPanel plugin is currently in public BETA and still under development, you will notice that the directory only contains 12 themes at the moment. I am currently in the process of adding themes to the directory and it will grow in number.
