## For Web Hosting Companies
---

1. Earn monthly recurring revenue from the listing and sales of WordPress themes.
2. Offset your cPanel license fees (due to recent increases).
2. Beginner friendly, simple & fast WordPress auto-installer.
3. Reduce WordPress related support tickets (we provide links to documentation & tutorials for WordPress).


## For WordPress Theme Developers
---

1. Distribute your themes directly to your target audience (bypass Google, WordPress.org, ThemeForest & Mojo Marketplace).
2. Guaranteed minimum number of daily downloads (avoid over-saturated & hyper-competitive marketplaces & directories).
3. Proportional listing fees (based on a multiple of the amount you sell your theme upgrade).
4. Cancel anytime, no contract, no cancellation fees (listing fees will be prorated by day, for example, if listing fees costs $200 a month but you cancel half way trough, we'll only charge you $100).
