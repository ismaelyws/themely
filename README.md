#### My Mission

**Help web hosting companies & WordPress theme developers make more money.**


## For Web Hosting Companies
---

1. Earn monthly recurring revenue from the listing and sales of WordPress themes.
2. Offset your cPanel license fee increases (due to recent changes).
3. Beginner friendly, simple & fast WordPress auto-installer.
4. Reduce WordPress related support tickets (we provide links to documentation & tutorials for WordPress).
5. Security minded - we set secure default usernames, passwords and database table prefixes.
6. Clear & intuitive cPanel icon & title (so users don't have to search or ask support techs where to install WordPress).
7. We only approve themes to our directory that meet our strict quality & security standards.


## For WordPress Theme Developers
---

1. Market your free or freemium* themes directly to your target audience (bypass Google, WordPress.org, ThemeForest & Mojo Marketplace).
2. Guaranteed minimum number of daily downloads (avoid over-saturated & hyper-competitive marketplaces & directories).
3. Proportional listing fees (based on a multiple of the amount you sell your theme upgrade).
4. Cancel anytime, no contract, no cancellation fees (listing fees will be prorated by day, for example, if listing fees costs $200 a month but you cancel half way trough, we'll only charge you $100).
5. Short review process (7-10 days compared to 3-5 months with WordPress.org)

*freemium = free with option to upgrade*
